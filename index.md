# About me

I'm studying Computer Science at Arizona State University. Recently, I worked as an Android Development Intern for General Motors here in Arizona. Now I'm back in class and actively looking for an internship for the summer of 2017.

Mobile Development has become my passion and this site shares both my projects and my inspiration for them. Feel free to reach out to me at <bbauman1@asu.edu>.
