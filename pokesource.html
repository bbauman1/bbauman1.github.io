							<p>PokéSource was released a couple weeks after Pokémon GO came out. I wrote all of the code for the Android app and my friend <a href="http://cameron.cool/">Cameron</a> wrote the iOS app. We weren't sure how this type of app would be received. Pokémon GO was everywhere, on every phone, but we were releasing an app that was initially useless. Early adopters would be given an empty map without Pokémon locations on it. And yet our app's success was up to them. If they didn't begin to place locations, then nobody would. It started off slow, but grew at what seemed to be an exponential rate. Soon we had 1,000 locations marked, then 2,000, then 5,000.</p>
							<p>As the hype for Pokémon GO has slowed, so has PokéSource's downloads. On average, 40 people download the Android app per day and basically nobody downloads the iOS version. We aren't bothered by this, our Pokémon craze has died as well so we aren't surprised. We didn't advertise the app anywhere, just let the insane popularity of Pokémon GO do it's thing. This carried us to over 10,000 downloads between the two apps.</p>
							<h3>How We Made it</h3>
							<p>We used standard Android and iOS development tools (Android Studio/Java, XCode/Swift) and Firebase as our backend. Firebase is something I'd used before and have continued to use since making this app. I can't stress enough how quick and easy it is to do so much magic with Firebase. To this day we haven't been charged a penny and development was a breeze.</p>
